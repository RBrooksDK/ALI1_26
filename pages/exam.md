### Exam prerequisites: 
None

### Exam type
The exam has two parts:

- The first part is a Flowlock exam in Wiseflow.
- The second part is a Wiseflow exam without Flowlock.
The second part must be completed in the Jupyter Notebook environment and the answers must be submitted in Wiseflow.

Part 1 has a duration of 3 hours and part 2 has a duration of 1 hour. The exam has a total duration of 4 hours. 
The student will not be able to access the second part before the first part is concluded.

### Submission Guidelines and Documentation
- All answers for both parts of the exam must be submitted through WiseFlow. Assignments not submitted in WiseFlow will not be awarded points.
- Documentation must be uploaded for assignments where relevant. Your documentation should clearly demonstrate how the results were obtained, either by including the relevant code or showing manual calculations. If a question is answered incorrectly and no documentation is supplied, no additional points can be given.
- Manual calculations must be compiled into **two** PDF documents at the end of the exam, one for Part 1 and one for Part 2. Do not upload individual images; instead, compile any images into a PDF file. If you have no manual calculations in Part 2 (e.g. if you used Python to solve the problems), you only need to upload documentation for Part 1.
- The Documentation Flow will be open 30 minutes after the exam concludes, allowing time to compile your documentation appropriately.
- All code must be submitted as a Jupyter Notebook using Python.
- Ensure that all code has been executed before submission so that the output is visible to the examiner without the need to re-run the code.
- For all assignments completed in Python/Jupyter Notebook, include the assignment number as a comment above the corresponding code block.
- When compiling your documentation, assignments must be presented in their numerical order (e.g., Assignment 1 followed by Assignment 2, then Assignment 3, and so on). While you are free to complete the assignments in any order, your submission must follow this prescribed sequence.

### Exam aids

- Students are permitted to bring their own calculators to the exam.
- Students will have access to [https://calculator-1.com/scientific/](https://calculator-1.com/scientific/) during Part 1.
- **Part 1** is conducted in the FlowLock environment, allowing students to use printed notes, books, and access local PDF files.
- **Part 2** is conducted without FlowLock, granting students the freedom to use any programming environment.
- Internet access is strictly limited to WiseFlow for both parts of the exam.
- The use of AI tools is prohibited in both parts. Violations will result in immediate expulsion from the exam.
- Communication with others is strictly forbidden in both parts of the exam.

### Inserting answers in WiseFlow

- If the result is a number and no specific format is stated, it must be expressed as either a positive integer, a fraction, or a combination of both.
- All signs will be pre-printed. For example, if the result is −3, you only need to enter the value 3; the negative sign will already be provided.
- Fractions must be presented in their irreducible form – sometimes the numerator or the denominator will be preprinted.
- When decimal input is required, the exercise will specify the required precision. For instance, if the result is 3.485763283, and you are instructed to round to four decimal places, the correct answer would be 3.4858.
- Decimal values must always be expressed using dot notation, e.g., 0.23, not 0,23.


### Re-exam
Re-exams may be oral.
